## üìÑ Documentation

Please refer to our official [Platform Documentation](https://mtda.cloud/en/docs/) and to our [Wiki](https://github.com/meta-d/ocap/wiki) (WIP).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### With Docker Compose

- Clone repo.
- Make sure you have Docker Compose [installed locally](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).
- Copy `.env.compose` file into `.env` file in the root of mono-repo (the file contains default env variables definitions). Important: the file `.env.compose` is different from `.env.sample` in some settings, please make sure you use the correct one!
- Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up`, if you want to run the platform using our prebuild Docker images. _(Note: it uses latest images pre-build automatically from head of `master` branch using GitHub CI/CD.)_
- Run `docker-compose up`, if you want to build everything (code and Docker images) locally. _(Note: this is extremely long process, option above is much faster.)_
- Open <http://localhost:4200> in your browser.
- The first time you will enter the onborading page. Follow the prompts to complete the initial settings ( organization, samples and connect your data source), and then you can start using it.
- Enjoy!

### Manually

#### Required

- Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download) LTS version or later, e.g. 18.x.
- Install [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) (if you don't have it) with `npm i -g yarn`.
- Install NPM packages and bootstrap solution using the command `yarn bootstrap`.
- Copy [`.env.local`](./.env.local) file into `.env` and adjust settings in the file which is used in local runs.
- Run command `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d` to start PostgreSQL database and redis services.
- Run both API, UI and OLAP engine with a single command: `yarn start`, or run them separately with `yarn start:api`, `yarn start:cloud` and `yarn start:olap`.
- Open Metad OCAP UI on <http://localhost:4200> in your browser (API runs on <http://localhost:3000/api>).
- Onboarding...
- Enjoy!
