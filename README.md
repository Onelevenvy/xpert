**Xpert AI** is an open-source enterprise-level AI system that perfectly integrates two major platforms: agent orchestration and data analysis.

## üí° What's New

**Agent and Workflow Hybrid Architecture**

In today's rapidly evolving AI landscape, enterprises face a critical dilemma: **how to balance the creativity of LLMs with the stability of processes?** While purely agent-based architectures offer flexibility, they are difficult to control; traditional workflows, though reliable, lack adaptability. The **Agent and Workflow Hybrid Architecture** of the Xpert AI platform is designed to resolve this conflict ‚Äî it allows AI to possess "free will" while adhering to "rules and order."

## [Agent Orchestration Platform](https://mtda.cloud/en/docs/ai/)

By coordinating the collaboration of multiple agents, Xpert completes complex tasks. Xpert integrates different types of AI agents through an efficient management mechanism, utilizing their capabilities to solve multidimensional problems.

## [Data Analysis Platform](https://mtda.cloud/en/docs/models/)

An agile data analysis platform based on cloud computing for multidimensional modeling, indicator management, and BI display. It supports connecting to various data sources, achieving efficient and flexible data analysis and visualization, and provides multiple intelligent analysis functions and tools to help enterprises quickly and accurately discover business value and make operational decisions.

### ChatBI

[ChatBI](https://mtda.cloud/en/docs/chatbi) is an innovative feature we are introducing, combining chat functionality with business intelligence (BI) analysis capabilities. It offers users a more intuitive and convenient data analysis experience through natural language interaction.
